# shell-"engine"
# this is a group project that we need to build our own shell "engine" to mimic some of the functionalities of a Linux shell. It recreated some built-in commands such as cd, 
exit, path, myhistory. It also supports commandline features like I/O Redirection, Commands Pipelining, Signal Control and a small Bash Interpreter that can execute simple batch
script.
